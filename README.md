### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Concepts, a Developer.
I have been dabbling in the arts of computer science for around 7 years. Currently, I am doing Roblox freelancing for short-term and commission-based jobs. I am gaining knowledge and more for my portfolio, along with earning some cash on the side. I have plans on getting into larger-scale game development and web design in the very near future. If you are interested in contacting me regarding a job, please contact me on Discord.
